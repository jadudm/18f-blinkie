## Getting Started

Congratulations! Your 18F blinkie is artistnal, Maine-made craft electronics **that you can program to blink**. 

To use your 18F blinkie:

## Programming Your Blinkie

Your blinkie is based on the [QtPy](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600), an open hardware product produced by [Adafruit Industries](https://www.adafruit.com/about), an incredible woman-founded-and-owned company based in NYC. This means you can [program your blinkie](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py) using any programming language supported by the QtPy: C/C++, Python, [Forth](https://learn.adafruit.com/alternative-languages-for-programming-SAMD-boards/forth), and [Lisp](https://learn.adafruit.com/alternative-languages-for-programming-SAMD-boards/lisp), to name just a few.

My personal favorite, however, is MakeCode.
